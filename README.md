# Kabanero.io Documentation
This repository holds the documentation for the kabanero-io site **Docs** area. These docs are dynamically pulled in during the [Kabanero-website](https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-website) build process.

# How to contribute to the documentation

## Before You Start
  * Click the `fork` button to create your fork of the `docs` repo. Make changes on your fork then open a pull request against `kabanero-io/docs:master` when you're ready for the changes to be reviewed and merged.

## Doc format

You have 2 options when creating docs: Markdown and AsciiDoc.
   * We use Jekyll, which uses the [kramdown](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/#kramdown) Markdown renderer, which still supports standard Markdown with some minor modifications.
   * We use the [Jekyll-asciidoc](https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc) plugin, which uses [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) to render [AsciiDocs](http://asciidoc.org/)

## Doc Front Matter
You need the proper front matter on each Docs page to get it categorized correctly. The `title` and the `doc-category` are the only one you should change.
  * For Markdown, use a YAML front matter
    ```
    ---
    layout: doc
    doc-category: Reference
    title: Connecting Kabanero to GitHub with Tekton Webhooks
    ---
    ```
  * For AsciiDoc, use `page-` AsciiDoc attributes in place.
    ```
    :page-layout: general-reference
    :page-doc-category: Configuration
    :page-doc-number: 1
    :page-title: Connecting Kabanero to GitHub with Tekton Webhooks
    :linkattrs:
    :sectanchors:
    ```

## Doc Categories

We currently have 4 categories you can use for the `doc-category` (markdown) or `:page-doc-category:` (AsciiDoc) front matter:

* Overview
* Installation
* Configuration
* Reference

If you need a new category feel free to open an issue or discussion in a pull request about the new category.

## Doc category order in table of contents

The [doc-categories.adoc](https://github.com/kabanero-io/docs/blob/master/doc-categories.adoc) file configures the order that the doc categories will show up on our table of contents for the website. Currently the order is:
  
   1. Installation
   1. Configuration
   1. Reference

This file should only be updated if a *new* category is added.
   * If a new category is added you must place your category in the `page-categories` in the order you want it to show up on the site.

## Doc Number

Definiens the order in which the doc is displayed in a given catigory. 
For example `:page-doc-number: 1` in the Configuration catigory will be listed in the doc dropdown menu before `:page-doc-number: 2` in the Configuration catigory.

Note: If you want to insert a new doc between two other docs use a numarical value between the two :page-doc-number values for example `:page-doc-number: 1.1`.

## Doc Syntax

Create a Markdown/AsciiDoc file that contains the documentation in a presentable format. For help on syntax you can view these references:

  * Syntax references
    * [kramdown syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html)
    * [AsciiDoc syntax](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/)
  * Editor options
    * See [kramdown live editor](http://trykramdown.herokuapp.com/)
    * See [AsciiDoc editor options](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/#using-a-web-browser-preview-only)

## Do Not Publish Doc Yet

If you want to get a Docs page ready ahead of time, but do not want it published to the site you can still contribute the file, but be sure to include the `published: false` front matter. When you are ready for the Docs page to be published, you can remove the `published` front matter variable:

  * For Markdown use `published: false`
  * For AsciiDoc use `:page-published: false`

## Add Images

To add an image to your Docs page, put the image in the `img/` directory. You can reference this image in your Docs page by using the path to the `img/` directory. For example, if you added `my_image.png` to the `img/` directory you can use that image with the following syntax:

- AsciiDoc format: `image::/docs/img/my_image.png[My image alt text]`.
- Markdown format: `![My image alt text](/docs/img/my_image.png)`

Note: The image will not show for the GitHub preview, but it will be linked on the website when it's deployed.

## Doc Location

In this repository you should place your new Docs page under the folder that best describes the documentation category. These folders are located in the [ref directory](https://github.com/kabanero-io/docs/tree/master/ref)

## Render Docs locally

Follow these instructions to render your docs in the website on a local dev environment.

### Prereqs

- [Local development setup](https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development-setup)

### Render your docs

1. From the kabanero-website repository root run the script: `./scripts/build_clone_docs.sh`
1. Create your new `.adoc` or `.md` file in `src/main/content/docs/ref/general/` and write in your doc content.
1. Copy any images that you are using in your doc to the `src/main/content/docs/img/` directory.
1. Start your local dev server using instructions from the [local dev setup](https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development-setup) and go to https://localhost:4000/docs in your browser to see all the Docs pages rendered.

= Appsody Hello World on Codewind

== Prerequisites
. https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/installlocally.html[Codewind] on Visual Studio Code or Eclipse
. https://appsody.dev/docs/getting-started/installation[Appsody]
. https://github.com/kabanero-io/appsodyExtension[Appsody Extension for Codewind]

== Getting started with VS Code

=== Creating a Java MicroProfile appsody Project
In VS Code open the command palette and navigate to the option `Codewind: Create New Project`. 
Select the Appsody Java MicroProfile template, give it a name and press enter. Navigate to the `Explorer` view. 
In the `Explorer` view keep expanding the Codewind section until the project you created is visible. 
At this point you can click the box with arrow icon next to the project to open it up in a browser, or the information icon to view the project overview.

The base url that you will be directed to doesn't have any information yet. However appending `/health` will display the health of the container.
Other built in endpoints are described on the bottom of the https://github.com/appsody/stacks/blob/master/incubator/java-microprofile/README.md[application stack's README] 

*NOTE:* The project might still be `starting` and you'll need to wait for it to be running.

== Getting started with Eclispe

=== Creating a Java MicroProfile appsody Project
Open up the Codwind Explorer in your Eclipse workspace by clicking `Window -> Show View -> Other... -> Codewind -> Codewind Explorer`.
Right click on the `Local Projects` under `Codewind` and select `New Project`. Select the Appsody Java MicroProfile template, give it a name and create it.
Now underneath your `Codewind -> Local Projects`, there should be your project. 
You can right click on the project and "Open Application" to view your app in your browser.

The base url that you will be directed to doesn't have any information yet. However appending `/health` will display the health of the container.
Other built in endpoints are described on the bottom of the https://github.com/appsody/stacks/blob/master/incubator/java-microprofile/README.md[application stack's README] 

*NOTE:* The project might still be `starting` and you'll need to wait for it to be running. Also you might need to refresh the project explorer to see the contents of your project directory.

== Hello World

=== Create the index.html
Right-click on the appsody project and chose the option to `Open Folder as Workspace`. In the project workspace, navigate to `src/main/webapp/` and create a new file there called `index.html`.
Open the file and add `Hello World`. Save the file and click the icon to open the app in your web browser again. You should see a webpage with `Hello World`. Now you can go back to the file and change it, save it, and then refresh the webpage.
The webpage will now be displaying your change. 

While this is only a basic Hello World html file, this same process goes for any changes in the project you want to make.

== Debugging
You can debug these applications as you would any other Codewind project.

Eclipse Codewind enables you to develop microservice applications from Kabanero Collections in an IDE. Follow one of these
links for your chosen IDE:

- link:installing-dev-tools.html#installing-codewind-for-vs-code[Installing Codewind for VS Code]
- link:installing-dev-tools.html#installing-codewind-for-eclipse[Installing Codewind for Eclipse]

== Installing Codewind for VS Code
The Codewind installation includes two steps:

. The VS Code extension installs when you install Codewind from the VS Code Marketplace or when you install by searching in the "VS Code Extensions" view.
. The Codewind back end containers install after you click "Install" when you are prompted. After you click Install, the necessary images are downloaded from the internet. The download is approximately 1 GB.

The following Codewind images are pulled. These images together form the Codewind back end:

* `eclipse/codewind-initialize-amd64`
* `eclipse/codewind-performance-amd64`
* `eclipse/codewind-pfe-amd64`

When the installation is complete, the extension is ready to use. For more information, see https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdt-vsc-getting-started.html[Getting started: Codewind for VS Code, window="_blank"].

=== Updating the Codewind plug-in
Update your Codewind plug-in without unintalling the extension.

. Go to the *Extensions* view in VS Code
. Search for the latest Codewind version in the Marketplace
. Install the latest version of Codewind. Then, reload Codewind
. Go to the *Explorer* view in VS Code
. Depending on the current status of Codewind, one of two messages appear:
* If the images from a previous version or release of Codewind are installed on the system, but Codewind is not running, a message asks you to install the most recent images. Click *OK* to start the download
* If an older version of Codewind is installed and running, a message asks you to update the older version. Click *OK,* and Codewind stops automatically, and new images begin to download
. Wait for the Codewind installation to complete. Codewind starts and is ready to use

When the installation is complete, the extension is ready to use, and you are prompted to open the Codewind workspace.
You can open the Codewind workspace or a project within the workspace as your Eclipse workspace. For more information,
see https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdteclipsegettingstarted.html[Getting started: Codewind for Eclipse, window="_blank"]

* On macOS and Linux, the workspace folder is `~/codewind-workspace`.
* On Windows, the workspace folder is `C:\codewind-workspace`.

When Codewind creates a new project, it is created in the Codewind workspace. If you want to add an existing project to Codewind, first copy it into the Codewind workspace.
